# Samplify
A File Manager based around music production and samples.

Music production has hundreds of great tools to allow creators to make new and amazing things, but searching for the right sounding sample when creators have libraries of thousands of files is impossible in modern softwares like Ableton Live and FL Studio. 

File organization is not the solution for these projects, but Tags.
Tags allow users to label each sample with certain traits that they can define. Label a sample with the tags *kick*, *short*, *trigger* and search for multiple tags at once to find the sample for the situation.

Optimized file loading prevents crashes, only loads supported files, and after a first launch it takes only seconds to start up.

Easy drag and drop from Samplify into your preferred DAW, similar to dragging it in from any OS File Explorer.

All work on this repository is most likely finished as a port to C++ using the JUCE library has been created.
